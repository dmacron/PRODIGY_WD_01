As a web development intern, I built an interactive navigation menu that changes color when you scroll down the page.
Created a responsive, fixed navbar with hover effects and a mobile-friendly dropdown menu.
Used JavaScript to change the navbarâ€™s background color based on scroll position.
Styled the layout using CSS Flexbox for a clean, modern design.
